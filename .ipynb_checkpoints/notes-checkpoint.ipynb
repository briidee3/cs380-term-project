It appears that `One Hot Encoding` would likely be the most useful one in our case; with One Hot Encoding, each new categorical value (i.e. 'Name: Jane Doe' or 'Job: Plumber') is given a column in a matrix. The values within each of the rows within those columns is binary, wherein 1 represents that it is of that category (i.e. 1 may represent 'Jane Doe' and 0 may represent 'not Jane Doe'). There is also `Label Encoding`, which works differently but in a similar vein, and may prove useful for the purposes of this project."
